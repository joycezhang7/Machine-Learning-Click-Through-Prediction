# Machine-Learning-Click-Through-Prediction

This project contains over 30m data about an anomalous online company. We used machine learning techniques to predict if the customer will click or not.

There are four files in thie project: 

"Model Selection" from Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

"1mBestLogisticModel" finds the best logistic model with randomly selected 1m sample with lowest log loss

"5mLogisticTest" to test the model above

"TestTransformation" to transform the test data the same way as the training data
